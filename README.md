# ttn-frontend-tutorial
Beginners tutorial for a TheThingsNetwork web front-end.
The Things Network Amsterdam gave a great workshop on building sensor nodes. To make it complete I set-up a personal project to create a front-end that stores sensor data and shows it on a sample website. Using, for me new tools like Node.js, RethinkDB and Websockets made it a great learing experience I want to share with you.

The developed project can be a starting point for your own learning experience or even a more serious use of data from TTN.

A lot of information can be found in the tutorial.pdf. It describes all steps to create the project and gives links to sources I used for learning.

We hope you like this little excercise.
